The application can also transform 2D maps into 3D globes, providing users with a unique and immersive experience. With AR Ricci Map, exhibition visitors can experience the maps in a new and engaging way, enhancing their understanding and appreciation of these important historical maps.

We aim to use 3D printed objects to serve as interactive mediums in enhancing AR situated visualizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project was awarded &lt;strong>about HKD$1M from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC)&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Areas of Excellence (AoE) Project - Centre for Slope Safety</title><link>https://wtong2017.github.io/projects/aoe_ssc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 23:17:09 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wtong2017.github.io/projects/aoe_ssc/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="">&lt;strong>Saving Hilly&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> is an immersive and educational AR game that instructs individuals on the importance of slope safety. Additionally, the game showcases state-of-the-art technology designed to help individuals deal with landslides. &lt;em>It is also presented in the poster session of IEEE VIS 2023.&lt;/em>

Lighting education is a foundational component of cinematography education. However, many art schools do not have expensive soundstages for traditional cinematography lessons. Thus, migrating physical setups to virtual experiences is a potential solution driven by metaverse initiatives. &lt;em>This project is also presented in IEEE VRW 2023, ACM MM 2023.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vispie</title><link>https://wtong2017.github.io/projects/vispie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 16:08:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wtong2017.github.io/projects/vispie/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://jasonwong.vision/projects/vispie">&lt;strong>VisPIE&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> aims at promoting sustainability lifestyle using XR, digital twin, and data visualization.
