The application can also transform 2D maps into 3D globes, providing users with a unique and immersive experience. With AR Ricci Map, exhibition visitors can experience the maps in a new and engaging way, enhancing their understanding and appreciation of these important historical maps.</description></item><item><title>Augmenting Situated Visualizations with Tangible User Interfaces</title><link>https://wtong2017.github.io/projects/tui4vis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 12:29:38 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wtong2017.github.io/projects/tui4vis/</guid><description>The goal of this project is to bring data analysis into everyday life for better sensemaking in situ by introducing a better user interface for AR situated visualizations. We aim to use 3D printed objects to serve as interactive mediums in enhancing AR situated visualizations.
This project was awarded about HKD$1M from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC).</description></item><item><title>Areas of Excellence (AoE) Project - Centre for Slope Safety</title><link>https://wtong2017.github.io/projects/aoe_ssc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 23:17:09 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wtong2017.github.io/projects/aoe_ssc/</guid><description>Saving Hilly is an immersive and educational AR game that instructs individuals on the importance of slope safety. Additionally, the game showcases state-of-the-art technology designed to help individuals deal with landslides. It is also presented in the poster session of IEEE VIS 2023.

Lighting education is a foundational component of cinematography education. However, many art schools do not have expensive soundstages for traditional cinematography lessons. Thus, migrating physical setups to virtual experiences is a potential solution driven by metaverse initiatives. This project is also presented in the poster session of IEEE VRW 2023.</description></item><item><title>Vispie</title><link>https://wtong2017.github.io/projects/vispie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 16:08:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wtong2017.github.io/projects/vispie/</guid><description>VisPIE aims at promoting sustainability lifestyle using XR, digital twin, and data visualization.
