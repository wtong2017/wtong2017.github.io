I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [School of Performance, Visualization and Fine Art](https://pvfa.tamu.edu/) (PVFA) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) (TAMU). I received my Ph.D. degree in the department of Computer Science and Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org) and [Prof. Ting Chuen Pong](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/ting-chuen-pong) at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk) (HKUST). I have visited [Dr. Yalong Yang](https://vis.yalongyang.com/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) during summer 2022. I successfully defended my thesis titled *"Towards Effective Data Visualization by Fusing Immersive Technology with Traditional Workflow"* on August 18, 2023.

<!-- I was one of the core member in both [Pulse of HKUST](https://pulse.ust.hk) and [XR-Vis group](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/groups/xr-vis) of [VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk). -->

My research interests lie in the area of *AR/VR/MR*, *Data visualization*, and *Humanâ€“computer interaction*. Specifically, I focus on **bringing data visualization beyond traditional workspace (i.e., personal computer) to everyday life using AR/VR technology for more efficient and effective data exploration and analysis**. I am a faculty member of Visual Computing and Computational Media (VCCM) Session. 

I am actively seeking 1-2 motivated and passionate PhD students to join my research team starting from Fall 2025. If you are eager to engage in cutting-edge research about AR/VR/MR, data visualization, and human-computer interaction, and ready to take on new challenges, I encourage you to reach out and explore this opportunity with me. **Please also don't hesitate to contact me for any collaboration opportunities or inquiries.**
