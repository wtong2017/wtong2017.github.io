I am currently an assistant professor for the Section of Visual Computing & Computational Media and Virtual Production Institude in the [College of Performance, Visualization and Fine Art](https://pvfa.tamu.edu/) (PVFA) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) (TAMU).
I lead the [VVAI Lab](https://vvai-lab.github.io/) (Visualization, Virtual reality, Augmented reality, and Interaction Lab).
I received my Ph.D. degree in the department of Computer Science and Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org) and [Prof. Ting Chuen Pong](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/ting-chuen-pong) at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk) (HKUST). 
<!-- I have visited [Dr. Yalong Yang](https://vis.yalongyang.com/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) during summer 2022.  -->
<!-- I successfully defended my thesis titled *"Towards Effective Data Visualization by Fusing Immersive Technology with Traditional Workflow"* on August 18, 2023. -->

My research interests lie in the area of *AR/VR/MR*, *Data visualization*, and *Humanâ€“computer interaction*. Specifically, I focus on **bringing data visualization beyond traditional workspace (i.e., personal computer) to everyday life using AR/VR technology for more efficient and effective data exploration and analysis**.
