I am currently an assistant professor for the Section of Visual Computing & Computational Media and Virtual Production Institude in the [College of Performance, Visualization and Fine Art](https://pvfa.tamu.edu/) (PVFA) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) (TAMU). I received my Ph.D. degree in the department of Computer Science and Engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org) and [Prof. Ting Chuen Pong](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/ting-chuen-pong) at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk) (HKUST). 
<!-- I have visited [Dr. Yalong Yang](https://vis.yalongyang.com/) at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/) during summer 2022.  -->
<!-- I successfully defended my thesis titled *"Towards Effective Data Visualization by Fusing Immersive Technology with Traditional Workflow"* on August 18, 2023. -->

My research interests lie in the area of *AR/VR/MR*, *Data visualization*, and *Humanâ€“computer interaction*. Specifically, I focus on **bringing data visualization beyond traditional workspace (i.e., personal computer) to everyday life using AR/VR technology for more efficient and effective data exploration and analysis**.

I am actively seeking **1-2 motivated and passionate PhD students** to join my research group starting from Fall 2025! If you are eager to engage in cutting-edge research about AR/VR, data visualization, and human-computer interaction, and ready to take on new challenges, I encourage you to reach out and explore this opportunity with me. **Please complete the [expression of interest form](https://forms.gle/z3ynVaXrZtsHTVqx8) if you are interested in joining my research lab.**
Please also don't hesitate to contact me at wtong(at)tamu(dot)edu for any collaboration opportunities or inquiries.
