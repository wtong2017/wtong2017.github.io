I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org) and [Prof. Ting Chuen Pong](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/ting-chuen-pong) at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk) (HKUST). I have visited [Dr. Yalong Yang](https://vis.yalongyang.com/) at Virginia Tech during summer 2022.

My research interests lie in the area of VR/AR, Data visualization, and Humanâ€“computer interaction. Specifically, I focus on bringing data visualization beyond traditional workspace (i.e., personal computer) to everyday life using AR/VR technology for more efficient and effective data exploration and analysis.

I am one of the core member in both [Pulse of HKUST](https://pulse.ust.hk) and [XR-Vis group](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/groups/xr-vis) of [VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk). I love music and playing board games and video games.

My Curriculum Vitae could be found [here](/cv.pdf). **I am also looking for research scientist or faculty position from fall 2024. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.**
