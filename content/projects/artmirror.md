[Art Mirror](https://github.com/metaartmirror/artmirror) is a VR soundstage for teachers and students to emulate cinematography lighting in virtual scenarios.

<!-- Lighting education is a foundational component of cinematography education. However, many art schools do not have expensive soundstages for traditional cinematography lessons. Thus, migrating physical setups to virtual experiences is a potential solution driven by metaverse initiatives.  -->
