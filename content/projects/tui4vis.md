The goal of this project is to bring data analysis into everyday life for better sensemaking in situ by introducing a better user interface for AR situated visualizations. We aim to use 3D printed objects to serve as interactive mediums in enhancing AR situated visualizations.

This project was awarded **about HKD$1M from the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC)**.
